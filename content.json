Mr Kalanick seems to have decided that accepting a slice of gold with a side-dish of crow is better than continuing a bloody battle in hopes of getting silver or bronze. The brash Silicon Valley giant has done what seemed unthinkable just a few weeks ago: surrendered. On August 1st Uber agreed to hand over its Chinese operations to Didi, in return for a 17.7% stake in the combined company’s equity. Uber, though, will get only 5.9% of the voting rights in the new entity. Investors in Uber China, including Baidu, a big Chinese internet firm, will get a 2.3% stake. Mr Kalanick will serve on Didi’s board, and Cheng Wei, Didi’s boss, will join Uber’s board. The deal is a boon for both companies, but especially so for Uber. For years Uber has lagged behind Didi, which has an estimated four-fifths of the Chinese ride-hailing market (see chart). Critics of Uber’s record in China say the American firm was both late to the market and sometimes flat-footed as it tried to adapt. For too long it used Google maps, which do not work well in China, before switching to a local service. Another problem, not of its own making, was that it offered a credit-card-based payment system even though such cards are not widely used on the mainland. Many people prefer to transact using WeChat, a hugely popular messaging app. But WeChat (whose owner, Tencent, is an investor in Didi), sometimes blocked Uber from the superapp, wounding its business. In contrast, Didi proved a nimbler innovator than Uber and other rivals expected. It used its early presence in the market to establish its operating platform on a large scale, says Jeffrey Towson of Peking University. It started with taxi-hailing, not chauffeur-driven cars, which helped it win over grumpy taxi drivers and local politicians. In time, it added bus-hailing, car-pooling that came to resemble social networking and other inventive offerings. And it was able to integrate its service early on with WeChat. The two firms’ race was an extremely costly one: in two years, Uber lost $2 billion in China; Didi is believed to have lost far more. An investor close to both companies claims that Uber China lost $250m just in the past month, which he believes gave it no choice but to succumb. The money mainly went on subsidies to lure both drivers and passengers. Investors on both sides approve of the arrangement. But it was Uber’s investors who had been growing particularly queasy about the bloodbath in China. A long fight in China could have drained its resources and forced it to raise more money, diluting their stake. Uber, for its part, can console itself that the deal this week smooths the way for its expected initial public offering, which losses in China had reportedly held up. The stake in Didi should rise in value, and Uber can take a share of Chinese growth without having to spend another tuppence there. By striking the deal, Uber will have outdone Facebook, Google and Amazon in China, says Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital, an investor in Uber who sits on its board. The deal raises three big questions. One is what the alliance means for the global ride-hailing market. When it was at war with Mr Kalanick, Didi had invested in Uber’s rivals, including Lyft in America, Ola in India and Grab in South-East Asia, in an attempt to weaken its enemy. The three smaller firms also formed an alliance to share technology and tips so as to better fight Uber. Now it is the alliance between Uber and Didi that seems strongest. The Chinese firm even agreed this week to invest $1 billion in the American startup. There are whispers that Didi and Uber are quickly moving forward with plans to carve up the world between them. As a result, Lyft, Ola and Grab may not be able to count on Didi’s cheque-book being open far into the future (although rumours surfaced this week that Didi is in fact involved in a new $600m round of financing for Grab and will continue with it). And the small fry now find themselves with a conflicted investor, who can try to influence their direction but has a strong, strategic relationship with their chief rival, Uber. Lyft and the others may try to find new backers to buy Didi’s stakes in them, but in the meantime it brings uncertainty to these firms. Speculation that predated this week’s news, that Lyft could be sold, has grown stronger still. Fare trade A second question is about the effect of the deal on ride-hailing customers. Consumers have been complaining noisily this week on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, that fares have already shot up. An Uber driver in Shanghai says that pre-deal, he earned a subsidy at rush hour worth 1.8 times the fare. This will not last. And if a popular backlash grows from both consumers and drivers, it will focus attention on the Chinese government and its plans for the country’s ride-hailing market. Just before the news of the agreement between Uber and Didi, seven ministries jointly announced a new law that legalises online ride-hailing services for the first time—and, in effect, bans all subsidies. Some have claimed that the new law is a factor in why Uber China sold out. Because the underdog in ride-hailing markets typically needs subsidies more than the dominant firm, the new regime would have harmed it most had it stayed the course in China. But people familiar with the deal confirm that negotiations have in fact been under way for weeks, and say the new law was rather the final straw for the American firm. A last question is how the Chinese authorities will treat the deal. The Ministry of Commerce on August 2nd tartly rejected Didi’s claim that the deal was not subject to anti-trust scrutiny. Given public disgruntlement, it is likely to give the deal a noisy vetting. But the government has also allowed lots of big mergers and quasi-monopolies in various sectors of the internet already. It has a penchant for national champions, and Didi, after digesting its chief foe in China, will certainly be one. 1.词汇 ride-hailing 打车服务 truce 休战协定 forerunner 创始人 surrender 投降 brash 傲慢的 stake 赌注；股票 equity 普通股 boon 恩惠 board 董事会 lag behind 落后 flat-footed 无准备的 transact using WeChat 用微信支付 nimbler-nimble 更敏捷的 grumpy 性情乖戾的 succumb 被压垮 lure 诱惑 subsidy 补贴 tuppence 两便士；微不足道的东西 outdo 胜过 speculation 投机买卖 backlash 强烈抵制 foe/rival 竞争者 merger 并购 quasi-monopoly 准垄断 ​ 2.句子 Mr Kalanick seems to have decided that accepting a slice of gold with a side-dish of crow is better than continuing a bloody battle in hopes of getting silver or bronze.
